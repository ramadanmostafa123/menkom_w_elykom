# Waste Classification Application

an application used for waste classification. In this project, I have developed a machine learning model to identify the type of waste being presented and connected this model using tflitev2. A simple user interface has been designed to facilitate the use of the application.

## Application Features:
- **Waste Classification:** The application uses a machine learning model to classify the type of waste being presented.

- **Login Functionality:** The application allows login for three types of users:
  - person user.
  - Waste disposal company.
  - Recycling company.

## Project Technologies:
- **Machine Learning:** I have developed a machine learning model to classify waste types.
- **tflitev2:** tflitev2 is used to link the machine learning model to the application.
- **firebase:** auth  and firebaseFirestore
